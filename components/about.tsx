            <p>
              I'm a passionate Data Science graduate with a Master's degree from the University of Guelph, specializing
              in machine learning, business intelligence, and full-stack development. My work focuses on transforming
              complex data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, I'm developing intelligent solutions that bridge the gap between data science and practical
              applications. From analyzing $38M+ in revenue through Power BI dashboards to building ML models that
              predict crop yields with 90% accuracy, I enjoy tackling challenges that require both technical expertise
              and creative problem-solving.
            </p>

            <p>
              My experience spans across various domains including business intelligence, recommendation systems, and
              interactive data visualization. I'm particularly interested in projects that combine machine learning with
              real-world impact, helping organizations make data-driven decisions that matter.
